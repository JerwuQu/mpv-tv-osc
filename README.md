# mpv-tv-osc

OSD Overlay to change media settings from a TV-like controller that only has arrows, select and back.

Run `update.sh` to install the latest release on linux. Alternatively [grab it yourself](https://github.com/JerwuQu/mpv-tv-osc/releases/latest), or compile with `make` (using the TypeScript compiler `tsc`).

The menu is bound to alt+u by default but can be changed by adding `<key> script-binding toggle-tv-osc` to `input.conf`.
